        <p>Congratulations on booking your first lash extension appointment! Whether you're visiting one of our Orange County studios or another lash salon, proper preparation ensures you'll have the best possible experience and beautiful, long-lasting results. Here's everything you need to know before your appointment.</p>

        <h2>24-48 Hours Before Your Appointment</h2>

        <h3>Skip the Lash Curler</h3>
        <p>Stop using mechanical lash curlers at least 48 hours before your appointment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Curlers can crimp or damage natural lashes</li>
          <li>Bent lashes make extension application more difficult</li>
          <li>Your extensions will provide all the curl you need</li>
          <li>Damaged lashes may not hold extensions properly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Avoid Lash Treatments</h3>
        <p>Hold off on these lash treatments before your appointment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lash lifts or perms (wait at least 6-8 weeks)</li>
          <li>Lash tinting (can be done, but isn't necessary with extensions)</li>
          <li>Growth serums containing prostaglandin (may affect adhesive)</li>
          <li>Any harsh chemical treatments near the eye area</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Review Your Medications and Allergies</h3>
        <p>Be prepared to discuss with your Orange County lash artist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any eye-related medications or conditions</li>
          <li>Known allergies (especially to adhesives or latex)</li>
          <li>Thyroid medications or conditions affecting lash growth</li>
          <li>Recent eye surgeries or procedures</li>
          <li>Use of Accutane or similar medications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Day of Your Appointment</h2>

        <h3>Remove All Eye Makeup Thoroughly</h3>
        <p>This is the single most important preparation step:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove all mascara completely (use oil-free remover)</li>
          <li>Clean away any eyeliner, especially waterproof formulas</li>
          <li>Remove eyeshadow and any eye primer</li>
          <li>Ensure no makeup residue remains on lash line</li>
          <li>Clean mascara can prevent proper adhesive bonding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arrive with Clean, Dry Lashes</h3>
        <p>Your lash artist will cleanse your lashes, but starting clean helps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wash your face before leaving home</li>
          <li>Use an oil-free facial cleanser</li>
          <li>Pat lashes dry gently with a clean towel</li>
          <li>Avoid applying any products to eye area</li>
          <li>No moisturizer, primer, or serums near eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skip Contact Lenses</h3>
        <p>For comfort and safety during your appointment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove contact lenses before arriving (or bring case and solution)</li>
          <li>Your eyes will be closed for 1.5-2 hours</li>
          <li>Contacts can become uncomfortable during application</li>
          <li>Bring glasses if needed for driving home</li>
          <li>You can resume wearing contacts 24 hours after appointment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dress Comfortably</h3>
        <p>You'll be lying down for extended time, so wear:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfortable, loose-fitting clothing</li>
          <li>Avoid turtlenecks or high necklines that might interfere</li>
          <li>Layer clothing as room temperature varies</li>
          <li>Skip uncomfortable bras or restrictive waistbands</li>
          <li>Remove any jewelry that might be uncomfortable lying down</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Plan for Relaxation Time</h3>
        <p>Prepare for a relaxing 1.5-2 hour experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't schedule back-to-back appointments</li>
          <li>Use the restroom before your appointment begins</li>
          <li>Silence your phone or put it on do-not-disturb</li>
          <li>Many clients fall asleep during application – embrace it!</li>
          <li>Allow extra time for consultation and aftercare instructions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Bring to Your Appointment</h2>

        <h3>Essential Items</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Photo Inspiration:</strong> Save images of lash styles you love</li>
          <li><strong>Sunglasses:</strong> Your eyes may be sensitive to light afterward</li>
          <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Cash, card, or verify accepted payment methods</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance Card:</strong> If applicable for medical reasons</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional Comfort Items</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Lip balm (your mouth may get dry)</li>
          <li>A light sweater or blanket if you tend to get cold</li>
          <li>Headphones if your salon allows (ask in advance)</li>
          <li>Water bottle (though you'll keep eyes closed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Pre-Appointment Considerations</h2>

        <h3>Caffeine and Hydration</h3>
        <p>What you consume affects your comfort:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit caffeine – too much can make it hard to stay still</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated but don't overdo it (long appointment)</li>
          <li>Avoid alcohol the night before (can affect eye moisture)</li>
          <li>Eat a regular meal before your appointment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Timing Your Appointment</h3>
        <p>Choose your appointment time wisely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Morning appointments mean fresh, rested eyes</li>
          <li>Avoid scheduling during allergy-heavy times of day</li>
          <li>Don't book right after work if you're typically tired</li>
          <li>Allow time to relax before the appointment</li>
          <li>Consider Orange County traffic when planning arrival time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Menstrual Cycle Considerations</h3>
        <p>Some women are more sensitive during certain times:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hormones can affect eye sensitivity</li>
          <li>Some experience increased irritation during menstruation</li>
          <li>Consider scheduling during the second week of your cycle</li>
          <li>Everyone is different – track what works for you</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Any lash loss or damage history</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>What to Expect During Your First Appointment</h2>

        <h2>Mental Preparation for Success</h2>

        <h3>Set Realistic Expectations</h3>
        <p>Understand what lash extensions can and cannot do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extensions enhance natural lashes but work within your natural base</li>
          <li>Sparse natural lashes may require volume techniques for fullness</li>
          <li>Your first set helps you learn what you prefer</li>
          <li>Adjustments and refinements are normal at fill appointments</li>
          <li>Photos may show dramatic examples not suitable for everyone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Embrace the Learning Curve</h3>
        <p>Your first set is a learning experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You'll learn what length and curl work best for you</li>
          <li>Aftercare becomes second nature within a week</li>
          <li>Retention often improves as you perfect your routine</li>
          <li>Don't be discouraged if you need adjustments</li>
          <li>Communication with your artist is key</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Plan for Adjustment Period</h3>
        <p>Allow yourself time to adjust to extensions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lashes may feel slightly unusual for the first day or two</li>
          <li>Seeing yourself with enhanced lashes takes getting used to</li>
          <li>Your morning routine will change (less makeup needed!)</li>
          <li>You'll develop new habits for cleansing and care</li>
          <li>Most clients wonder how they ever lived without them!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Orange County Specific Preparations</h2>

        <h3>Traffic and Parking Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan for Orange County traffic delays</li>
          <li>Arrive 5-10 minutes early for paperwork</li>
          <li>Locate parking in advance (street vs. lot)</li>
          <li>Consider carpooling or rideshare if parking is limited</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-Appointment Activities</h3>
        <p>Plan appropriately for after your appointment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No swimming or water exposure for 24 hours</li>
          <li>Avoid intense workouts the same day</li>
          <li>Skip the beach or pool the day of your appointment</li>
          <li>Give yourself time to admire your new lashes!</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Consider scheduling a patch test 48 hours before</li>
          <li>Discontinue any new eye products a week before</li>
          <li>Ask about sensitive adhesive formulas</li>
          <li>Bring allergy medication if prescribed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If You Wear Glasses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Inform your lash artist about frame style</li>
          <li>Certain lengths may be adjusted to prevent touching lenses</li>
          <li>Curl type can be customized for glasses wearers</li>
          <li>Extensions actually work beautifully with glasses!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If You Have Very Short or Sparse Lashes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be honest about your concerns during consultation</li>
          <li>Volume lashes may be recommended for fullness</li>
          <li>Shorter extensions can still create beautiful enhancement</li>
          <li>Professional application works with any lash type</li>
        </ul>
