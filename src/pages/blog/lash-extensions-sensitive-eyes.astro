        <h2>Understanding Eye Sensitivity & Lash Extensions</h2>

        <h2>Best Lash Styles for Sensitive Eyes</h2>

        <h3>Classic Lashes</h3>
        <p>Often the best choice for sensitive eyes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One extension per natural lash</li>
          <li>Minimal adhesive contact</li>
          <li>Lightweight and comfortable</li>
          <li>Natural appearance</li>
          <li>Easy to maintain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A gentle compromise for more volume:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mix of classic and light volume</li>
          <li>Still relatively minimal adhesive use</li>
          <li>Natural-looking fullness</li>
          <li>Good for slightly stronger eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lash Lift Alternative</h3>
        <p>For very sensitive eyes, consider a lash lift:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Works with your natural lashes</li>
          <li>No adhesive near the lash line</li>
          <li>Lifting serum applied to mid-lash</li>
          <li>Lasts 6-8 weeks</li>
          <li>Can combine with lash tint</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Products to Avoid with Sensitive Eyes</h2>

        <h3>Makeup & Skincare</h3>

          <li><strong>Heavy eye creams:</strong> Can migrate to lash line</li>
          <li><strong>Glycolic acid near eyes:</strong> Too strong for sensitive skin</li>
          <li><strong>Fragranced products:</strong> Additional irritation risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lash Care Products</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Harsh lash cleansers with strong detergents</li>
          <li>Alcohol-based removers</li>
          <li>Products with synthetic fragrances</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Can I get lash extensions if I have extremely sensitive eyes?</h3>
        <p>Most people with sensitive eyes can successfully wear lash extensions with the right products and techniques. We recommend starting with a consultation and patch test to ensure the best outcome.</p>

        <h3>What if I have a reaction to the extensions?</h3>
        <p>If you experience any adverse reaction, contact us immediately. We'll schedule a prompt removal appointment at no charge and help you understand what caused the reaction.</p>

        <h3>Are there any medical conditions that absolutely prevent lash extensions?</h3>
        <p>Active eye infections, uncontrolled blepharitis, severe eczema around the eyes, or recent eye surgery may require waiting or medical clearance. We're happy to discuss your specific situation.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if I'm reacting to the adhesive or the lashes themselves?</h3>
        <p>Adhesive reactions typically occur within 24-48 hours and involve redness, itching, or swelling near the lash line. Lash material reactions are rare but would show similar symptoms. A patch test can help identify the cause.</p>
